[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0-blue.svg)](src/mpath-unity-project/Packages/MPath/package.json)

A high-performance A* implementation for 2D grid navigation, optimized for speed and minimal memory allocations.

## Features

- Fast A* pathfinding with near-zero garbage collection overhead
- Allocates memory only when necessary to maximize performance
- Designed for 2D grid-based navigation
- Works in Unity projects and any other type of .NET applications
- Extensively tested with comprehensive unit tests
- Includes performance benchmarks

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** MPath is not yet thread-safe and should not be used across multiple threads.

## Benchmarks

### Complex Maze Pathfinding

*The complex maze used for benchmarking*
</details>

The following benchmark was run on a complex maze to test pathfinding performance. The test involved finding a path from coordinates (10, 10) to (502, 374) through a maze with narrow passages and dead ends. All benchmarks were implemented using [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/).

These results highlight MPath's optimization for both speed and memory efficiency. Memory allocation in MPath is required only for the initial pathfinder creation and for the final path result creation, with no GC pressure during the pathfinding algorithm execution. 

## Installation

<details>
<summary>Unity (via OpenUPM) - Recommended</summary>

### Option 1: Using OpenUPM CLI

1. Install the [OpenUPM CLI](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html#installing-openupm-cli)
2. Run the following command in your Unity project folder:
   ```
   openupm add com.migsweb.mpath
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Installation via manifest.json

1. Open your Unity project's `Packages/manifest.json` file
2. Add the OpenUPM registry and the package to the file:
   ```json
   {
     "scopedRegistries": [
       {
         "name": "OpenUPM",
         "url": "https://package.openupm.com",
         "scopes": [
           "com.migsweb.mpath"
         ]
       }
     ],
     "dependencies": {
       "com.migsweb.mpath": "1.0.0",
       // ... other dependencies
     }
   }
   ```
3. Save the file and Unity will automatically download and install the package
</details>

<details>
<summary>Unity (via Git URL)</summary>

Add MPath to your project via the Unity Package Manager:

1. Open the Package Manager window in Unity (Window > Package Manager)
2. Click the "+" button and select "Add package from git URL..."
3. Enter the following URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/migus88/MPath.git?path=/src/mpath-unity-project/Packages/MPath
   ```

To use a specific version, append a tag with version (e.g `1.0.0`) to the URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/migus88/MPath.git?path=/src/mpath-unity-project/Packages/MPath#1.0.0
   ```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Unity (via .unitypackage)</summary>

1. Download the latest `.unitypackage` from the [Releases](https://github.com/migus88/MPath/releases) page
2. Import it into your Unity project (Assets > Import Package > Custom Package)
</details>

<details>
<summary>.NET Projects (via NuGet)</summary>

### Option 1: Using Package Manager Console (Visual Studio)

```powershell
Install-Package Migs.MPath
```

### Option 2: Using .NET CLI

```bash
dotnet add package Migs.MPath
```
</details>

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of using MPath in a .NET project:

```csharp
// Create a 10x10 grid
var cells = new Cell[100];
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
    int x = i % 10;
    int y = i / 10;
    cells[i] = new Cell
    {
        Coordinate = new Coordinate(x, y),
        IsWalkable = true,
        Weight = 1.0f
    };
}

// Add some obstacles
cells[12].IsWalkable = false;
cells[13].IsWalkable = false;

// Create a simple agent
var agent = new SimpleAgent { Size = 1 };

// Configure and create pathfinder
var settings = new PathfinderSettings { IsDiagonalMovementEnabled = true };
using var pathfinder = new Pathfinder(cells, 10, 10, settings);

// Find a path
var start = new Coordinate(1, 1);
var end = new Coordinate(8, 8);
using var result = pathfinder.GetPath(agent, start, end);

// Use the path
if (result.IsSuccess)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Path found with {result.Length} steps!");
}
```

- [.NET Projects](docs/guides/getting-started.md) - More detailed examples for .NET projects

### Important Notes

- Always dispose `PathResult` objects after use (use `using` statements)
- Reuse the pathfinder instance for best performance
- For larger grids, consider using dynamic grid updates to improve performance
